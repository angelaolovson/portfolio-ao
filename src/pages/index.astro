			<p>
			Welcome to my journey. As you noticed, I have background coming from other industries.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
			After several years of working experiences, I would say I love what I was doing but also excited of what I am going to do. Fashion and floristry industries brought me 
			
			I find inspiration in the world around me, whether through the pages of a captivating novel, the intricate
			details of typography, or the vibrant hues of nature during my outdoor escapades.
